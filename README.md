# Study of the synchronization of monetary, credit and business cycles

## Objective of the project: 
This project is carried out with SAS. It analyze the synchronization of the credit and monetary cycles with the business cycle. Our study is based on a database about the United States from January 1972 to October 2020. Using an Hodrick-Prescott filter to define the cycles we then use two methods: the cross-correlation and the synchronization event. We obtain common results between the two methods. The synchronization between money and production is generally weak, which explains the inefficiency and abandonment of monetary policies. While the synchronization between credit and production is generally high. However, we do not end up with to a perfect synchronization. This imperfect synchronization explains the difficulties of Government intervention to promote growth.
